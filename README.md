### About me

After a long tenure in the restaurant hospitality industry, I am making a career change into software engineering.

Currently I am pursuing my second degree in computer science at UMGC, and anticipate graduating in May 2025.

I am working as a frontend developer and engineer intern at cybersecurity start up, Cambridge Cloudworks.

I'm looking for an apprenticeship at this time to further develop my technical skills towards software engineering.

Outside of school I am developing my skills in Java and teaching myself C++.

### More Fun About Me

- I love reading, I'm currently on a fantasy and sci-fi kick.
- I'm in the process of learning how to do a handstand.
- I have two cats, one of which is in my profile picture (Both of them supervise my Zoom meetings at my internship)
- I love eating at restaurants even though I no longer want to work in them.
